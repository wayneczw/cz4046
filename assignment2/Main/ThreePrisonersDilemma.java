	 defection. 
	 
	 Recall that in the 2-players dilemma, U(DC) > U(CC) > U(DD) > U(CD), where
	 we give the payoff for the first player in the list. We want the three-player game 
	 to resemble the 2-player game whenever one player's response is fixed, and we
	 also want symmetry, so U(CCD) = U(CDC) etc. This gives the unique ordering
	 
	 U(DCC) > U(CCC) > U(DDC) > U(CDC) > U(DDD) > U(CDD)

	 So payoff[i][j][k] represents the payoff to player 1 when the first
	 player's action is i, the second player's action is j, and the
	 third player's action is k.
	 
	 In this simulation, triples of players will play each other repeatedly in a
	 'match'. A match consists of about 100 rounds, and your score from that match
	 is the average of the payoffs from each round of that match. For each round, your
